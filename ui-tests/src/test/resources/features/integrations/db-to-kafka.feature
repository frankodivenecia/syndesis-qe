  Background: Clean application state
    Given clean application state
    And deploy Kafka broker
    And log into the Syndesis

#    this sleep is necessary, because AMQ streams autodiscovery process takes some time so streams are not available immediately
#    and unfortunatelly there is no indication of autodiscovery process status yet. see issue ENTESB-13113
    When sleep for "150000" ms
    And created Kafka connection using AMQ streams auto detection using "PLAIN" security
